Within each subfolder is a `topology.py` file that defines any exportable symbols.  Typically, consumers should **import** these root constructs (e.g., [RivUserPortal](userportal/topology.py)) versus directly **import** private implementation details (e.g., [RivUserPortalCompareFaces](userportal/functions/definitions.py)).
