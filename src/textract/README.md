# Textract Operations

[Amazon Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) is a machine learning service that automatically extracts text, handwriting and data from scanned documents that goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents like PDFs, images, tables and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration which often times requires reconfiguration when the form changes. To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Textract uses machine learning to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text, handwriting, tables and other data without any manual effort. You can quickly automate document processing and take action on the information extracted whether it be automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and receipts. Textract can extract the data in minutes vs. hours or days.
